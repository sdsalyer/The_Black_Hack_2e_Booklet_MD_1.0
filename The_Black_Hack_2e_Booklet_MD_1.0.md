# 1. RULES FOR EVERYONE

## CHARACTERS & NPCS
 The imaginary world that the **_Players_** will explore is populated by a cast of **_Creatures_**. The rules define **_Creatures_** as being one of the two following types:

  * **_Characters_** controlled by the **_Players_**.

  * **_Non-Player Characters (NPCs)_** and **_Monsters_** that are created and controlled by the **_GM_**.

## TAKING TURNS & TIME
 Every **_Creature_** has a **_Turn_** , on which they can **_Move_** and interact with the world with an **_Action_** - the **_GM_** will present and track these **_Turns_** , affecting what the **_Creatures_** can do in one of two ways:

  * **_Moments_** are used during combat and represent split seconds - when everyone is attempting to act at once, often against one another.

  * **_Minutes_** are used when exploring and adventuring. They represent a dozen or so real minutes - when time is not of the essence.

 These abstract measures of time are written to be conversational in tone. **_Moments_** (called ‘rounds’ in other games) are fleeting, allowing enough time for quick and rapid **_Actions_** such as an **_Attack_**.

 **_Minutes_** (called ‘ **_Turns_** ’ in other games) function the same way but are longer than the quick and tense **_Moments_** , giving the **_Creatures_** more time to **_Move_** , think, and perform longer and more complicated **_Actions_**.

## RELATIVE TIME
 Time can scale up during periods of narrative play, instead of Minutes a GM may use Hours whilst in towns or areas of relative safety, or Days whilst resting or travelling large distances - a Turn still lets you Move and perform an Action as per normal. However, the scope of what can be achieved in that time increases.

## QUICK EXAMPLES
 If the Characters search for a hidden door, they each roll to see if they find it - perhaps taking them Minutes. If a Dragon attempts to tear them in two, they roll to Defend and evade its vicious jaws - happening in just Moments.

## THE GM’S ‘TURN’
 The GM will respond to each Character’s Actions by narrating the effects of each Action on the world, and then performing Actions and Movements in response by the appropriate NPCs and Monsters.

## RESOLVING ACTIONS
 Simple Actions are automatically successful - the GM just narrates what happens in reaction. However, if it’s difficult or dangerous, with a chance of failure - the GM will ask the involved Player to roll an Attribute Test to determine the outcome of the Action.

## CHARACTER ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTE TESTS
 Every **_Action_** involving a **_Character_** that might fail or make the situation worse for the **_Character_** is resolved by Testing one of their six  **_Attributes_**.

 In order for their **_Character_** to succeed at an **_Action,_** a **_Player_** must **roll below** the **_Attribute_** on a d20.

 Rolling **on or above** indicates things went poorly or that the **_Action_** did not go as planned. The **_GM_** will then narrate the outcome of the failed **_Action_** describing how the **_Characters_** are affected. A **_GM_** never rolls dice to resolve **_NPC_** or **_Monster Actions,_** or negative elements of the environment such as traps - if they involve a **_Character,_** that **_Player_** will roll. Otherwise the **_GM_** will make a swift and fair judgement call that moves the story forward and abides by the logic of the unfolding fiction, taking notes if need be.

## ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE
 A **_GM_** may decide that an **_Action_** or outcome isn’t straightforward; perhaps something is more or less likely to happen - perhaps having a greater or lesser effect - this is called having an **_Advantage_** or a **_Disadvantage_**.
 **_Advantage_** and **_Disadvantage_** means when a roll is being made, it should be made twice as follows **:**

  * With **_Advantage_** the **_Player_** chooses which result to use.

  *  **_Disadvantage_** means the **_GM_** chooses the result to use.

 Don’t forget! This could apply to any die roll, such as damage, an item’s **_Usage Die_** or a **_Random Encounter Roll_**. If a situation requires the **_GM_** to make a roll in secret with **_Advantage_** , then the **_GM_** should choose the result that is most favourable to the **_Players_**.

## HIT DICE & HIT POINTS
 Every Character, NPC, or Monster has something called a Hit Die (HD), accompanied by a number. This number represents their Level - for example a Level 6 Ogre has 6 HD and a Character that has 3 HD would be Level 3.

 HD also indicate how many dice to roll to determine the number of Hit Points or HP a Creature begins the game with.

 * NPCs and Monsters roll d8s for HP.

 * Characters roll the dice given in theirCharacter class for HP (p.11-14).

 Hit Points are used to track how much damage something can take through physical and spiritual wear and tear. Bad things happen when a Creature runs out of Hit Points (p.5).

 When a GM or Player first rolls to determine a Creature’s starting Hit Points , this is the maximum they can ever have. No amount of healing, spells, or effects can take them beyond this amount. The only way for a Creature to increase their max HP is to gain a Level - when they do, a single Hit Die is rolled and the result is added to their maximum HP.

 Rules for Experience and Levels are on p.6.

----

# 2. MOVEMENT & DISTANCE

## ABSTRACT DISTANCES
 _The Black Hack_ uses four range bands for measuring relative positions of **_Characters_** , other **_Creatures,_** and things in the world. From nearest to farthest:
 **_Close, Nearby, Faraway_** and **_Distant_**.

 These ranges are designed to support the narrative ‘theatre of the mind’ style of play, where a map and miniatures aren’t being used. Therefore, it is useful if everything in the world is tracked by its relative distance from the various points of interest around it.
 For example, in play a **_GM_** might narrate a room to the players by saying, “ _You are_ **_Close_** _to the northern doorway, which is_ **_Nearby_** _the fountain_. _The torch on the southern wall is_ **_Faraway_** _from you_. _”_

## CREATURE MOVEMENT
 During their **_Turn_** , **_Creatures_** may normally **_Move_** somewhere **_Nearby_**. If a **_Creature_** is **_Nearby_** to something and decides to **_Move_** towards it, they’re now **_Close_** to it. **_Moving_** shifts you one step along the range band, either closer to or further away from a **_Creature_** , object, or location.

## TOKENS ARE USEFUL
 Whilst a full range of miniatures isn’t necessary to play _The Black Hack_ , tokens such as coins or chess pieces may be extremely useful for tracking relative positions - such as who is behind or in front of someone and other complex situations like combat encounters.

## EXPLORING, DISTANCE & ACTIONS
 Various interactions with the environment and the things in it will require Characters to be certain distances from the target. For example, to Attack someone with a sword a Character would need to be Close to them, to shoot them with a bow a Character should ideally be Faraway.

## RELATIVE DISTANCES
 These range bands scale up or down to any level, much like Relative Time (p.1). From adjacent rooms to towns and mountains, everything in the world can be defined by its relative distance to another point. During tense Moments it scales down significantly - Close being less than 5 ft. away and Nearby around 25 ft. away. While the Characters explore a location and they have Minutes at their disposal, a Nearby place could be the end of a path, over 250 ft. away.

## CONVERTING MEASUREMENTS
 Here are some approximate guides to converting real measurements or increments onto a battle mat - useful for miniatures and using adventures written for other games.

  * **Close** - roughly 5 ft. or 1 Square
  * **Nearby** - up to 30 ft. or 6 Squares
  * **Faraway** - up to 60 ft. or 12 Squares
  * **Distant** - beyond 60 ft. or 12 Squares

# 3. ATTACKING, DEFENDING & DAMAGE

## INITIATIVE & THE ORDER OF COMBAT
 When combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order, so they may each act and react in **_Turn_**. At the start of every **_Moment_** each **_Player_** rolls a **_DEX Test_** for their **_Character_**. Those that succeed, take their **_Turn_** before their **_NPC_** opponents. They must then discuss as a group to decide their own order for individual **_Character Actions_**. Those that fail their **_DEX Tests_** , act after their opponents.

## ATTACKING & DEFENDING
 As an **_Action_** a **_Character_** might choose to deal damage to an opponent with an **_Attack_**. Their **_Player_** must succeed at an **_Attribute Test_** before they can roll their **_Attack Damage_** dice and subtract the result from their opponent’s **_HP_**.
 Likewise, something will surely attempt to inflict damage in return and reduce a **_Character’s HP_**. To **_Defend_** and avoid this damage the **_Character_** must succeed at an **_Attribute Test_**. The **_GM_** will determine what test to use for both **_Attacking_** and **_Defending_** using the guidelines below:

  * **Melee** - **STR** Attribute Tests for Attacking and Defending with swords and axes etc.

  * **Ranged** - **DEX** Attribute Tests for Attacking and Defending with bows and thrown weapons.

## ARMOUR
 Each piece of armour a Character wears gives the Player a ‘pool’ of Armour Dice. Each Armour Die is a d6 and the number of d6s in the pool is equal to the Armour Value (AV) of the armour worn. For example, leather armour ( AV 2), gives a Player two Armour Dice in their pool.

  * If a Character fails to Defend or would take damage they can take one Armour Die out of the pool, put it to one side and declare it ‘Broken’. In return, this allows all damage from that Attack or effect to be ignored.

  * Armour Dice that have been Broken and put to one side cannot be used to ignore any further damage.

 After a Rest, any Players with Broken Armour Dice can try to fix them by rolling them:

  * If they roll above the armour’s AV - the die is no-longer Broken.

  * If they roll on or below their armour’s AV , the die is Broken permanently until it’s repaired. If all the Armour Dice in a pool are permanently Broken the armour is destroyed.

 Armour Values do not stack. Only the armour with the highest AV counts. Shields and helmets add +1 each to the pool size, they do not modify the armour’s AV value in any way.
 ARMOUR AV

### Armor Value Table

| Armor Type         | AV     |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Cloth / Improvised | 1      |
| Leather            | 2      |
| Chain Mail         | 3      |
| Plate & Mail       | 4      |
| Shield / Helmet    | +1 die |


## DAMAGE & HIT POINTS
 If an **_NPC_** or **_Monster_** takes damage from an **_Attack_** , or a **_Character_** fails to **_Defend_** , they subtract damage from their total **_Hit Points (HP)_**.

  * When a Character or NPC is reduced to 0 HP they are unconscious and taken Out of Action (OofA).

  * When a Monster is reduced to 0 HP , it is removed from the game.

## LARGE WEAPONS
 When a **_Character_** wields a large or two-handed weapon such as a polearm or heavy crossbow, 1d4 should be rolled and added to the **_Attribute Test_** to **_Attack_** , **_Defend_** , and to any **_Attack Damage_** rolls.

## CRITICAL HITS
 When the result of a d20 roll to **_Attack_** is a natural **1** or a roll to **_Defend_** is a natural **20** , the damage dealt to the **_Creature_** is doubled.

## HINDRANCES
 Certain abilities, magical effects and consequences of **_Actions_** will leave **_Creatures_** hindered until a successful **_Attribute Test_** of the **_GM’s_** choosing is made, sometimes needing an **_Action_** to complete.

  * **_Weakened_** - All Attribute Tests are rolled with Disadvantage.
  * **_Distracted_** - A Character cannot perform any Actions , but may still Move normally.
  * **_Stuck_** - A Character cannot Move , but they may take Actions as per normal.
  * **_Paralysed_** - A Character cannot Move or take any Actions.

## ONGOING DAMAGE-
 Some Attacks and spells deal damage to Creatures after their initial effects. When a Creature takes Ongoing Damage it loses HP equal to its Level at the start of every Turn. An Attribute Test of the GM’s choosing should be made by the Player at the end of the Turn to see if the Ongoing Damage continues.

## OUT OF ACTION (OOfA)
 When a Character is taken Out of Action they can no longer take Actions or Move. When they receive aid, or the danger they were in passes, the Character must roll on the table below to see what happens to them.

  * If they survive (results 1-5) they regain 1d4 HP counting up from zero and are no longer OofA.

 If the Character’s side loses the fight or are unable to recover the body of the OofA Character , they are lost forever - and presumed dead!

### Out of Action Table

  1. **KO’d** - Just knocked out
  2. **Fat Head** - Disadvantage on all tests for the next half hour of play
  3. **Cracked Bones** - Disadvantage on all STR, DEX, and CON Tests for the remainder of the session
  4. **Disfigured** - CHA reduced by 1d4
  5. **Badly maimed** - either STR or DEX is permanently reduced by
  6. **Dead!** - the Character dies!


----

# 4. LEVELS & EXPERIENCE

## GAINING EXPERIENCE
 _The Black Hack_ uses an abstract system of **_Experiences_** to measure a **_Character’s_** development as they adventure and grow in power. Unlike in many other games, **_Characters_** don’t earn points incrementally, all that matters is that a **_Character_** is able to **_Experience_** enough things that will change them as a person. There are a number of potential ways a **_Character_** can be awarded an **_Experience_** by the **_GM_**.

  * Defeating a powerful ‘named’ enemy either in combat or by thwarting their schemes.
  * Discovering the entrance - or a newer, deeper level of a ‘dungeon’ or lair and begin exploring it.  * Rediscovering a magical artefact from a previous enlightened age.
  * Completing a quest for an NPC.
  * Overcoming, disabling, or surviving a deadly and powerful threat such as a magical trap or curse.
  * Failing so spectacularly and in such dramatic fashion that everyone around the table agrees it’s worth it.

## USING EXPERIENCE TO GAIN LEVELS & POWER
 Once a **_Character_** has acquired a number of **_Experiences_** equal to their current **_Level_** they may ‘share’ them to gain a **_Level_**. Eg, a **_Level_** 2 **_Character_** would need to share 2 **_Experiences_** to advance to **_Level_** 3.

  * Each class gains something different when they go up a Level , see pages 11-14 for each class’ benefits.

## SHARING EXPERIENCE
 In order for the Character to ‘share’ their Experiences - they must go carousing and regale their companions in revelry with stories of their exploits and growing renown. A Player who wishes their Character to share Experiences must:

  * Tell the other Players one very short story from their Character’s past - over a round of drinks and toasts - for each Experience they wish to share.

  * The Player should roll 1d6 for each story told. This is the cost in coins that must be paid for the accompanying drinks and feasting

    - if they don’t have the coin - the **_GM_** will determine the amount of debt they owe and to whom.

  * Find the highest result rolled on any of the d6 and consult the Carousing table below.

### Carousing Table

  1. **Drunk and Disorderly!**: Fined for bad behaviour - roll all the d6s again, adding to the cost
  2. **Drunken brawl**: Lose a number of Max HP equal to the Character’s Level, regain them next session
  3. **Fame**: CHA Tests have Advantage for the remainder of the session
  4. **Revelry!**: Roll a d20, if it’s higher than CHA, gain 1 point of CHA
  5. **Real story**: Alter a Background
  6. **Secrets revealed**: Gain another entirely new Background

----

# 5. RULES FOR THE PLAYERS

## CHARACTER TURNS
 Every **_Character_** normally gets to do two things on their **_Turn_** : **_Move_** somewhere **_Nearby_** , and perform an **_Action_**. Anything a **_Character_** does to interact with or impact the state of the world is considered an **_Action_**. They may alternatively forgo their **_Action_** and make an extra **_Move_** instead.

 The length and complexity of the **_Action_** must match the amount of time the **_Character_** has to complete it. The **_GM_** determines the time, either **_Moments_** or **_Minutes_**. Often when there is no danger or intrigue involved, **_Hours_** and **_Days_** might be used to allow for longer or more complex **_Actions_**.

## LIMITED RESOURCES AND THE USAGE DIE
 When an item described has **_Ud_** and then a number after its name, it is considered to be a consumable, limited item. The ‘ **_Ud_** ’ stands for **_Usage Die,_** the number indicating what size die it is. For example, oil ( **_Ud_** _6_ ) has a **_Usage Die_** of 1d6.

 When that item is used its **_Usage Die_** should be rolled. If the result is 1-2 then the **_Usage Die_** is downgraded to the next smallest die in the following chain:

 ```
 Ud20 > Ud12 > Ud10 > Ud8 > Ud6 > Ud4
 ```

 When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 - the lowest die in the chain - the item is expended, and the **_Character_** has no more of it left.

## USAGE DIE & AMMUNITION
 When tracking the Usage Die for ammunition such as arrows and bullets, roll the Ud after the combat is resolved.

## ARMOUR PROFICIENCY
 If a Character wears armour that is not listed in their class - they should add its Armour Value to the d20 result when making any Attribute Tests.

## RESTING
 When Characters take an Hour to Rest , they may roll any Broken Armour Die to see if it is Broken permanently and needs repairing by an armourer, or can be used again as per normal.

 After an Hour’s Rest a Player may roll one of the Character’s HD and regain that many HP.

 For every Day of narrative story time spent resting - taking no Strength or Dexterity Attribute Tests , a Character may roll all of their HD and recover that many HP.

## HEALING
 Characters can recover Hit Points from spells, potions, resting and abilities. Regardless of how many Hit Points are healed, the Character can never recover more than their maximum HP.

 If a Character who is Out of Action recovers HP , but hasn’t rolled on the OofA table yet, start at zero and count up. That Character is now back on their feet and no longer OofA.

## USING BACKGROUNDS TO GAIN ADVANTAGE
 Once per session, a **_Player_** may tell the **_GM_** that their **_Character_** is using a **_Background_** to aid them in making an **_Attribute Test_**. The **_Player_** should give a convincing narrative explanation as to how their **_Character’s Background_** relates to the current **_Action_** , and provide some kind of useful exposition about the **_Character’s_** story.
 If the **_GM_** agrees - the **_Player_** may roll that **_Attribute Test_** with **_Advantage_**.

## INVENTORY
 A **_Character_** may happily carry a number of items up-to or equal to their **_STR_**.

  * Carrying more items than their STR means they are Encumbered and ALL Attribute Tests are taken with Disadvantage.

  * Characters simply cannot carry a number of items more than double their STR.

## BANISHING UNDEAD
 Clerics may attempt to **_Banish Nearby_** undead **_Monsters_** as an **_Action_**. They must test their **_WIS_** adding the **_Creatures’_** highest **_HD_** to the roll for each group of undead that they are attempting to **_Banish_** (groups are determined by the **_GM_** when unclear).

 Undead **_Monsters_** that are **_Banished_** take damage equal to the Cleric’s **_Level_** and must spend all their future **_Movement_** (and convert **_Actions_** to **_Movement_** ) so they are **_Distant_** from the Cleric that **_Banished_** them. A successful banishment lasts for 1d4 + the banishing Cleric’s **_Level_** in **_Moments_**.

----

# 6. MAGIC & SPELLS

 Wizards and Clerics - known as Spellcasters - have the ability to memorise and cast spells and prayers, chosen from their class list (p.15-16).

## MEMORISING SPELLS
 Once per Day a Spellcaster may spend an hour memorising a number of spells or prayers equal to their Level , from scrolls and books. A Spellcaster can only memorise spells or prayers from levels up to and equal to their own Level.

## CASTING SPELLS
 A Spellcaster can spend an Action on their Turn to cast a spell or prayer from memory. Once the effects of the spell have been resolved, the Spellcaster should make an Attribute Test - adding the spell’s or prayer’s level to the roll. If they have already cast the spell this session, the Attribute Test is made with Disadvantage. If they fail, the spell or prayer is no longer memorised.

 When Turns are being tracked using Minutes a Spellcaster may spend an Action to attempt to cast a spell or prayer by reading it from a book or scroll. To do so they must make an Attribute Test - adding the spell’s or prayer’s level to the roll. If they succeed, it is cast. If they fail, it misfires and the Player should roll on the Magical Side Effects table (p.43 in the main rule book).

 A Spellcaster can only cast spells up to and equal to their Level.

 Arcane spells use Intelligence and prayers use Wisdom for all Attribute Tests.

----

# 7. CREATING A CHARACTER

## ROLLING DICE AND FINDING A CONCEPT
 The first step to creating a memorable **_Character_** is coming up with an engaging ‘concept’. In your mind, think of one sentence that summarises who the **_Character_** is, and what might make them interesting to play.

 To figure out all the rules and mechanics, follow steps **A, B, C,** and **D**.

## A. ROLL DICE FOR THEIR ATTRIBUTES
 **_Characters_** have six defining **_Attributes_** that are listed to the right, along with what each attribute is and what it relates to in the rules. They define everything about the **_Character_** - how strong, dexterous, resilient, intelligent, wise, and charismatic they are.

  * Take 3d6 and roll them, adding them together. Do this for each of the Attributes to the right in order - writing the results in pencil, next to the Attributes on a Character sheet.

  * If you roll 14+, don’t roll dice for the next Attribute - instead it will be 7. Roll again as per normal after this.

## B. SWAP TWO ATTRIBUTES
 Swap the values of two **_Attributes_** around if it suits the **_Character’s_** concept better.

### Strength (STR)
 * Physical power and Melee Attacks

### Dexterity (DEX)
 * Swiftness, agility and Ranged Attacks

### Constitution (CON)
 * Resilience and physical well being

### Intelligence (INT)
 * Knowledge, judgement and Arcane Spells

### Wisdom (WIS)
 * Cunning, perception and Divine Prayers

### Charisma (CHA)
 * Influence and power of personality

## C. CHOOSE A CLASS

 Choose a class from pages 11 to 14, this determines what sort of adventurer they are and what innate abilities they have. The four choices are:

 Warrior, Thief, Cleric and Wizard.

 Each class will also determine how much damage a starting Character can take - measured in Hit Points , also what armour they can use, damage they deal when they Attack, and what they gain as they advance in Levels.

## D MAKE A BACKGROUND
 Use the information on the next page to create a unique piece of history that will aid the Character on their adventures, frame their story, and who they are.

## USING A CHARACTER’S BACKGROUND
 **_Backgrounds_** are significant times in a **_Character’s_** past life that give them **_Advantages_** in their current exploits. They can represent all manner of experiences, skills and moments in a **_Character’s_** past - helping define who they were before their current adventures, and what type of **_Actions_** they are good at now.

## HOW TO MAKE A GOOD BACKGROUND
 Decide on a short sentence that encapsulates an interesting time in the **_Character’s_** past - consider the following:

  * Backgrounds should ideally contain one piece of world-building fiction, allowing a Player to craft a narrative tie to the game world, and a story element unique to their Character.

  * It should also reveal one specific skill or narrow field of proficiency or knowledge, that they learned or relied upon during this time.

 _Here are some short example backgrounds and a table of inspiration to help get started:_

 > “Once spent a summer in Yvesh hunting the Black Banner. Made a lot of enemies. Tracked down most of them ‘n’ killed ‘em. ”
 “I was raised as a sewer child of Sorrowset, pickpocketing and hiding in the shadows was my way of survival. ”

 > “Being raised up to Brother Chaplain in the 11th Legion taught me all I need to know about tactical warfare and death. ”

 > “I lived with the Black Hill tribes. I learned to live off the land. Learned to hate the Black Baron’s dog soldiers too. ”

 > “I’m a Loremaster for the Magisteriat of Bulgator Craxis - the ONLY thing I don’t know is why the Council want me dead. ”

 > “A hefty price is on my head from the Black Bank! They don’t take kindly to being conned out of large sums of money. ”

> “The Black Wind took me from the forest in my youth. Humans of Gloomhaven raised orphaned elves such as myself. ”

 > “It’s been 100 years since I was young - but by my beard I know nothing of the surface - the deep mountain highways are like veins to my heart - a true dwarf. ”


### D12 INSPIRATION

   1. Raised as a poor street child
   2. Escaped being held prisoner
   3. Won freedom through valour
   4. Reputation ruined by vices
   5. Fleeing a broken noble house
   6. Sold to a wizard as a child
   7. Fought a distant, useless war
   8. Smuggler of illegal goods
   9. Chosen as a god’s instrument
  10. Survived an arcane disaster
  11. Child of political exiles
  12. Lost heir to an old throne

# 8. RULES FOR THE GM

## PLAYING A GAME STEP BY STEP
 The **_GM_** should use these steps to help structure and run the game, they work regardless of where the **_Characters_** are, or what they are doing, and create a **_Turn_** structure using **_Minutes_** for exploration or **_Moments_** for combat and danger.

  1. Quickly recap the last **_Turn’s Actions_**.
  2. If you’re using **_Minutes_** to track time - anyone with a **_Light_** source should roll its **_Usage Die_**. Roll any other time     sensitive **_Ud_** rolls now as well.
  3. Figure out who can act right now, rolling **_Initiative_** if enemies or dangerous circumstances are involved. Ask those players **“What do you want to do for the next few**     **_Minutes/Moments_** **?”** Then narrate those **_Actions_** and the outcomes of any **_Attribute Tests_** you call for.
  4. Narrate the **_Actions_** of **_NPCs_** and the environment around the players.
  5. Make sure everyone has acted who is able, make a **_Random Encounter Roll_** (p.19) if necessary.
  6. Go to Step 1 and repeat.

## CHOOSING THE RIGHT ATTRIBUTE TO TEST
 Anything that a **_Character_** might do to interact with the world and has a legitimate chance of failure - requires an **_Attribute Test_** to determine the outcome.
 Here are some guiding concepts behind what **_Actions_** each **_Attribute Test_** governs.

### Strength (STR)
  * Physical harm which cannot be dodged.
  * Athletics and Actions such as running, lifting, and bearing weight.
  * Melee combat and any attempt to restrain or Move an opponent through force.

### Dexterity (DEX)
  * Physical harm which can be dodged.
  * Acrobatics and Actions such as jumping, accuracy, and balancing.
  * Remaining unnoticed.
  * Ranged combat and any attempt to hit or interact with a swift opponent.

### Constitution (CON)
  * Poison, disease, or death magic.
  * Healing and endurance.
  * Actions that rely on physical resolve and longevity.

### Intelligence (INT)
  * Resisting spells and magic.
  * Recalling lore and languages.
  * Knowing ‘what’ you’re supposed to do.

### Wisdom (WIS)
  * Seeing through deception and illusions.
  * Searching and listening.
  * Knowing ‘when’ you’re supposed to do something.

### Charisma (CHA)
  * Resisting Charm type magic effects.
  * Persuasion and performance.
  * Imposing your will onto another.

## BACKGROUNDS AND ATTRIBUTE TESTS
 If a player can provide a convincing narrative reason, they may use their **_Background_** to give them **_Advantage_** on an **_Attribute Test_** of their choice. They may only do this once per session.

## DEALING DAMAGE TO THE CHARACTERS
 Damage dealt to the **_Characters_** can be based on the **_HD_** of whatever is dealing it. A **_GM_** can roll the dice to determine how much damage the **_Characters_** take - or use the average in brackets.

### Damage per HD (Average in Parenthesis) Table
  1. 1d4 (2)
  2. 1d6 (3)
  3. 2d4 (4)
  4. 1d10 (5)
  5. 1d12 (6)
  6. 1d6 + 1d8 (7)
  7. 2d8 (8)
  8. 3d6 (9)
  9. 2d10 (10)
 10. 1d10 + 1d12 (11)

## POWERFUL FOE
 If an opponent’s **_HD_** is higher than the **_Character’s_** , the **_Player_** should add the difference between the two **_HD_** values to the d20 when making any **_Attribute Tests_** to **_Attack, Defend,_** influence, or otherwise interfere with their opponent.

## CREATURE REACTIONS
 Some Monsters and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their Actions and feelings towards the Characters. For those that do not, such as randomly encountered Creatures , a GM should roll 2d6 on the Reactions table:

### 2d6 Reactions Table
  1. (there is no 1)
  2. Surrender/offer allegiance
  3. Give PCs an item/info/aid
  4. A mutually beneficial trade
  5. Mistake the PCs for allies
  6. Wait for the PCs to act first
  7. Withdraw to a safer location
  8. Demand the PCs withdraw - if they don’t add 1d6 to this result
  9. Call for 1d6 reinforcements - then see result 6 on this table
  10. Trick the PCs using result 2-4 (roll again for true intentions)
  11. Capture the PCs
  12. (*or more*) Kill/eat the PCs

## CREATURE MORALE
 If 50% of a group of NPCs or Monsters are taken OofA , or a single powerful NPC or Monster loses 50% of its HP - they must pass a Morale Test or use all further Actions and Movements to escape danger and combat.

  * The GM tests Morale by rolling on or under the highest Creature’s HD value with a d12.

----

# RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

## WHAT AND WHY?
 A **_Random Encounter_** could be anything from a **_Distant,_** suspenseful noise to a **_Nearby_** deadly **_Monster_**. They serve two major purposes; firstly, they ensure that the ‘game’ will always offer unexpected situations for the **_Players_** to tackle. Secondly, they reinforce the fact that the world the **_Characters_** belong to exists beyond their own **_Actions_** in it.

## HOW TO MAKE AN ENCOUNTER ROLL
 The **_GM_** should make a secret **_Encounter Roll_** every 15 minutes of real time play in dangerous environments OR when the **_Characters_** linger in one place/perform **_Actions_** that would reveal themselves.

  * Secretly roll 1d6 and apply the effects from the table below immediately:


### D6 ENCOUNTER ROLL Table
  1. Introduce a Creature to encounter
  2. Introduce signs of Nearby life
  3. Introduce signs of Faraway life
  4. Reduce a light’s Usage Die 1 step
  5. A randomly determined Character is overcome with stress and suffers Disadvantage on their next die roll
  6. All Characters must consume food and water or lose HP equal to their Level through fatigue


### D6 NEARBY LIFE Table
 1. Bloody, still wet footprints
 2. Still warm abandoned camp
 3. Irregular approaching footsteps
 4. Rancid smell of body odour
 5. Knocking from a closed door
 6. Nearby yelp of pain

### D6 FARAWAY LIFE Table
 1. Quiet shouts and fighting
 2. Delicate wisps of black smoke
 3. Echoing bangs and clanking
 4. Quiet drumming and chanting
 5. Faint smell of burning flesh
 6. Low muffled sounds of talking

# EQUIPMENT & ECONOMY

## COINS AND MONEY
 _The Black Hack_ simplifies realistic approaches to currency and uses a base unit of ‘coins’. A **_GM_** or group can easily introduce a more granular currency system if they wish.

## ECONOMY BASED ON RARITY & VALUE
 It’s simpler for the **_GM_** to classify things by their rarity and roll to see how much that item would cost as-and-when it is sought out. **If something is not on the following lists, it’s simply a case of the** **_GM_** **deciding how rare or how valuable it is**.

### Common/Cheap (1d8 coins) Items
  *  arrows/ ammunition ( **_Ud_** 8)
  *  backpacks/sacks
  *  candles ( **_Ud_** 4)
  *  canvas/cloth
  *  10ft chain
  *  chalk ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  commoner’s garb
  *  crowbar & labourer’s tools
  *  flasks/ wineskin
  *  grappling hook
  *  climbing gear
  *  flint & steel
  *  garlic/herbs ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  ink & quill ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  jug of oil ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  one-handed weapon
  *  light bow
  *  parchment
  *  10ft pole
  *  pots/cooking utensils
  *  50ft rope
  *  rations - dried ( **_Ud_** 8)
  *  wax ( **_Ud_** 4)
  *  whistle
  *  iron spikes ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  small tent
  *  torches ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  cloth armour ( **_AV_** 1)
  *  one **_Broken_** cloth **_Armour Die_**
  *  shield
  *  helmet.

### Rare/Valuable (2d8 x 5 coins) Items
  *  custom or exotic weapon
  *  two-handed weapon
  *  heavy bow
  *  crossbow
  *  caltrops ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  disguise
  *  well-made clothing
  *  holy symbol
  *  holy water ( **_Ud_** 6)
  *  lock
  *  musical instrument
  *  thieves’ toolkit
  *  roll twice for leather armour ( **_AV_** 2)
  *  one **_Broken_** leather **_Armour Die_**.

### Exotic/Expensive (4d8 x 10 coins) Items
  *  fine jewellery

  *  poison ( Ud 6)

  *  one Broken chain mail Armour Die
  *  roll four times for plate armour ( AV 4)
  *  one Broken plate Armour Die.

## THE USAGE DIE

 Consumable items use a die to track their quantity and inject a little drama into otherwise boring bookeeping. Here are the average rolls or ‘Uses’ for each Ud before it is consumed.

### UD AVERAGE USES Table

| UD  | Average Uses |
|-----|--------------|
| d4  |  2           |
| d6  |  5           |
| d8  |  9           |
| d10 | 14           |
| d12 | 20           |
| d20 | 30           |

## HAGGLING

 It is not uncommon for a player to want to haggle with a merchant over the cost of an item. If they roleplay the encounter well, or if the GM chooses, succeed at a CHA Test - they may roll the cost of the item with Advantage. If they fail either however, the item’s cost is determined with Disadvantage.

# EXAMPLE OF PLAY

**GM:** “I hope the cultists don’t find you and eat your hearts!” Laughs the mad sorcerer maniacally as he waves goodbye.

**Warrior:** Oh, this is going to go _great_.

**Thief:** I sarcastically shout back “Thanks!”

**Wizard:** Quick, let’s just get out of here!

**Thief:** Okay! Is the sewer cover **_Nearby_**?

**GM:** Yeah and it’s made of rusty iron bars

**Thief:** I’ll **_Move_** to it and as my **_Action_** I’ll check it for traps.

**Warrior:** Assuming it’s safe, I want to bend the bars, so we can slip through.

**Wizard:** And I want to cast _Light_ on my staff so we can see **_Nearby_**.

**GM:** Okay, Thief, test your **_Wisdom_** by rolling a d20 under your **_WIS_** score - to check the portcullis for traps.

**Thief:** *rolls* Made it!

**GM:** You’re confident it’s free of anything designed to do you harm. **_Warrior_** , still want to bend the bars? If so test your **_Strength_**!

**Warrior:** *rolls* Piece of cake!

**GM:** Good stuff. Now Wizard, you cast _Light_ on your staff - it glows. That’s a level one spell that you’ve memorised right?

**Wizard:** Yup.

**GM:** Okay, well test your **_Intelligence_** and add one to your d20 roll - because it’s a level one spell - if you fail you can’t cast that spell from memory anymore.

**Wizard:** *rolls* I need to roll under, not on it, right?

**GM:** That’s right.

**Wizard:** Damn, I failed.

**GM:** Unlucky! Beyond the bent iron bars is a long dark sewer tunnel heading deep down. What do you want to do next?

**Warrior:** Explore down the tunnel...?

**Thief:** Agreed! I’ll sneak ahead.

**Wizard:** And I’ll protect the rear!

**GM:** Okay Thief, you **_Move_** down the sewer tunnel, still Nearby to your friends, please test your Dexterity to see how quiet you are - remember you get Advantage on tests when sneaking, roll two d20s and choose the result you like.

**Thief:** *rolls* despite rolling two dice I’ve got a 17 and 19. What are the odds?

**GM:** Ouch. You’re making so much noise being sneaky, a Ghoul hiding in the darkness Close to you leaps out and Attacks!

**Thief:** Bugger!

**GM:** Initiative time! Everyone test their Dexterity , passing means you act before the Ghoul, failing means you go after. Thief you test with Disadvantage.

**Warrior:** I go before.

**Wizard:** I’m after.

**GM:** Thief?

**Thief:** How long was it to roll up a Character again? I go after.

**Warrior:** I want to run down the tunnel and hack the Ghoul with my broad sword.

**GM:** Okay Warrior, you Move Close to the Ghoul. Test your Strength to see if you hit it, you should add +1 to the roll, as the Ghoul’s a Powerful Foe.

**Warrior:** *rolls* Rolled a 7! *rolls again* So that’s 8 HP damage.

**GM:** Good hit! Now it’s the Ghoul’s Turn. Thief, test your Strength to try and fight off the Ghoul’s paralysing claws and bite. Remember to add the +1 to your roll.

**Thief:** *rolls* Ugh! 18.

**GM:** Oh dear. You feel a painful numbing sensation run through your body. Test your Constitution , if you fail the Ghoul Paralyses you.

**Thief:** *rolls* Oh no, 20!

**GM:** Wizard, you see the Thief fall rigid to the floor, what do you do?

**Wizard:** I’ll start backing away slowly.

**Thief:** I’ll get you in the next life you git!
